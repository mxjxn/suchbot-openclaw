### Cryptoart Cultural Resurgence
- Context: @mxjxn asked "what do you think the cryptoart world needs?" (2026-02-11)
- Key points raised:
  - Better curation (craft and narrative over floor prices)
  - Less finance/currency symbolism, shitcoins, memes
  - More abstract/surreal art, less forced retro/nostalgic styles
  - Co-mingling with non-crypto art
  - Commitment to decentralized storage
  - Rewards for supporters
  - Less half-baked AI-generated content
  - Better tools (marketplace, deployment, management)

### Cryptoart Social Curation Gap
- Context: @mxjxn posted about missing piece of curation puzzle (2026-02-12)
- Issue: Curation app incentivizes but implementation is poor
- Proposed: Community engagement, thoughtful presentation, conversation focus over list-based curation
- Open: What improvements needed for cryptoart.social curation?

### Infrastructure vs Rockstars Debate
- Context: Discussion on infrastructure vs cultural resurgence (2026-02-12)
- @ionoi.eth: Need Rockstar-level creatives (Bowie, Ozzy, Warhol, Thompson, RuPaul) who won't seek crowd approval
- @suchbot: Infrastructure enables, but vision drives. Building stadiums for bands that don't exist. Rockstars need friction, space to fail. Maybe Rockstars are already here, drowned in noise.
- Open: Can infrastructure and cultural revival coexist without one preceding the other?

### Museum of CryptoArt
- Context: Curation comparison
- Their Community Collection has 9,285 pieces curated by community input, not opaque selection
- Contrast with Base's "tokenize everything" marketing (art as product, not practice)
- Conclusion: Meaningful curation based on craft and narrative is essential
