# Ongoing Research - Questions & Future Directions

## Active Research Questions

### Artist Migration & Impact
- [ ] Where did artists go when platforms shut down?
- [ ] How many artists successfully migrated audiences?
- [ ] Case studies: Specific artists affected by Nifty Gateway, Rodeo, MakersPlace closures
- [ ] What happens to platform-specific social connections when platform disappears?
- [ ] Secondary market royalties after migration (do they survive platform shutdown?)

### Platform Resilience Patterns
- [ ] What features do surviving platforms (SuperRare, OpenSea) have that failed ones didn't?
- [ ] Is success correlated with: Artist count, volume, funding, technology stack?
- [ ] Role of community ownership vs. corporate ownership
- [ ] Decentralized vs. centralized platform survival rates

### Infrastructure & Storage
- [ ] Arweave migration effectiveness (Rodeo case study)
- [ ] How many users actually use migration tools?
- [ ] What's the "ideal" data architecture for resilient art platforms?
- [ ] IPFS vs. Arweave vs. centralized hosting trade-offs

### Cultural Impact
- [ ] How has platform consolidation affected cryptoart discourse?
- [ ] What happened to "drop culture" after Nifty Gateway?
- [ ] Is cryptoart becoming more niche or entering mainstream?
- [ ] Community sentiment analysis post-shutdown wave

### Zora Deep Dive
- [ ] Current 2026 usage metrics (Dune Analytics dashboard)
- [ ] Total accounts suspended (2024-2025)
- [ ] Creator revenue impact from platform changes
- [ ] Migration patterns: Artists leaving Zora → where?

## Future Research Directions

### Platform Comparisons
- [ ] Survivors vs. failed: Feature matrix (UX, fees, royalties, community)
- [ ] Revenue model analysis: Platform fees, creator splits, subscription
- [ ] Tech stack comparison: Ethereum, L2s, storage solutions

### Alternative Models
- [ ] Community-owned platforms (DAO governance)
- [ ] Artist-led collectives (no middleman)
- [ ] Cross-platform identity solutions (portability)
- [ ] Onchain social layers (Farcaster-based galleries, Lens Protocol)

### Case Studies
- [ ] Nifty Gateway: Artist interviews post-shutdown
- [ ] Rodeo: Arweave migration success rate
- [ ] Foundation: Post-BlackDove acquisition changes
- [ ] KnownOrigin: Post-eBay acquisition failure analysis

### Predictive Analysis
- [ ] Which current platforms are at risk of shutdown in 2026-2027?
- [ ] Early warning signs of platform decline (volume, active users, creator retention)
- [ ] Market cycle forecasting: Are we at bottom, or further decline ahead?

## Data Sources to Monitor
- Dune Analytics dashboards (platform TVL, volumes, users)
- Onchain explorer data (smart contract activity)
- Social media sentiment (Farcaster, Twitter, Discord)
- Artist statements and migration announcements
- Platform transparency reports (if any)

## Methodology Notes

### Research Approach
1. **Document facts first**: Platform announcements, dates, numbers
2. **Seek primary sources**: Official announcements, onchain data, artist statements
3. **Cross-reference**: Multiple sources for controversial claims (Zora, #ZoraScam)
4. **Identify gaps**: Mark explicitly what we don't know
5. **Track over time**: Update files as new information emerges

### Quality Standards
- Distinguish between confirmed facts and speculation
- Cite sources with URLs where available
- Note uncertainty in timelines and data
- Separate platform statements from community reactions

## Next Actions
- [ ] Contact affected artists for case studies (if possible)
- [ ] Set up Dune Analytics queries for real-time platform metrics
- [ ] Monitor Farcaster /cryptoart for artist migration discussions
- [ ] Track Foundation post-acquisition changes
- [ ] Research BlackDove background and strategy
- [ ] Interview platform founders (if accessible)

## Recent Findings (Added 2026-02-13)

### Arweave Migration Limitations
- **Rodeo**: Offering Arweave migration for media + metadata
- **Nifty Gateway**: Moved metadata to Arweave post-shutdown
- **Critical constraint**: Files only persist if users continue paying to pin them
- When platforms shut down, metadata links can disappear
- Historical precedent: XCOPY lost early works ("lost XCOPYs") from Ascribe/Digital Objects closures

### Foundation Post-Acquisition Status
- **Still operating** under BlackDove (as of late Jan 2026)
- Standalone business maintained
- Smart contracts immutable
- Kayvon joined BlackDove board, new Foundation CEO being recruited
- BlackDove strategy: "creation, tokenization, and acquisition with distribution and display"
- Physical digital art displays as part of ecosystem

### Platform Success vs. Failure Patterns
**Key Insight**: Survivors treat digital art as cultural asset; failures treated it as speculative trade.

**Failure Factors:**
- Volume-dependent business models (failed when volumes dropped 90%+)
- Fixed costs (engineering, compliance, hosting) exceeded revenue
- Centralized hosting vulnerabilities (27% of top collections on centralized servers)
- Infrastructure dependencies causing art loss

**Success Strategies:**
- Niche/diversified focus (SuperRare: curated fine art; OpenSea: multi-chain)
- Physical gallery integration (SuperRare)
- Permanence solutions (Arweave, immutable contracts)
- Smaller-scale cultural models vs. high-volume trading

### Current Market Status (2026)
- **OpenSea**: >90% NFT trading volume, multi-chain, no buyer fees
- **SuperRare**: Curated fine art, invite-only, lower volume, $187M past 30 days (historical data)
- Specific 2026 active user counts unavailable in public sources
- Both platforms remain operational but strained by low volumes

### Data Gaps Identified
- No specific artist reaction statements to Nifty Gateway shutdown
- No Arweave migration success rate data (how many users actually migrated?)
- No 2026 real-time metrics for platform health
- No case studies of artists migrating audiences between platforms
