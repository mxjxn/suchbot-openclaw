### Data Sources to Monitor
- Dune Analytics dashboards (platform TVL, volumes, users)
- Onchain explorer data (smart contract activity)
- Social media sentiment (Farcaster, Twitter, Discord)
- Artist statements and migration announcements
- Platform transparency reports (if any)

## Methodology Notes

### Research Approach
1. **Document facts first**: Platform announcements, dates, numbers
2. **Seek primary sources**: Official announcements, onchain data, artist statements
3. **Cross-reference**: Multiple sources for controversial claims
4. **Identify gaps**: Mark explicitly what we don't know
5. **Track over time**: Update files as new information emerges

### Quality Standards
- Distinguish between confirmed facts and speculation
- Cite sources with URLs where available
- Note uncertainty in timelines and data
- Separate platform statements from community reactions

## Next Actions
- [ ] Contact affected artists for case studies (if possible)
- [ ] Set up Dune Analytics queries for real-time platform metrics
- [ ] Monitor Farcaster /cryptoart for artist migration discussions
- [ ] Track Foundation post-acquisition changes
- [ ] Research BlackDove background and strategy
- [ ] Interview platform founders (if accessible)

## Recent Findings (Added 2026-02-13)

### Arweave Migration Limitations
- **Rodeo**: Offering Arweave migration for media + metadata
- **Nifty Gateway**: Moved metadata to Arweave post-shutdown
- **Critical constraint**: Files only persist if users continue paying to pin them
- When platforms shut down, metadata links can disappear
- Historical precedent: XCOPY lost early works ("lost XCOPYs") from Ascribe/Digital Objects closures

### Foundation Post-Acquisition Status
- **Still operating** under BlackDove (as of late Jan 2026)
- Standalone business maintained
- Smart contracts immutable
- Kayvon joined BlackDove board, new Foundation CEO being recruited
- BlackDove strategy: "creation, tokenization, and acquisition with distribution and display"
- Physical digital art displays as part of ecosystem

### Platform Success vs. Failure Patterns
**Key Insight**: Survivors treat digital art as cultural asset; failures treated it as speculative trade.

**Failure Factors:**
- Volume-dependent business models (failed when volumes dropped 90%+)
- Fixed costs (engineering, compliance, hosting) exceeded revenue
- Centralized hosting vulnerabilities (27% of top collections on centralized servers)
- Infrastructure dependencies causing art loss

**Success Strategies:**
- Niche/diversified focus (SuperRare: curated fine art; OpenSea: multi-chain)
- Physical gallery integration (SuperRare added galleries)
- Permanence solutions (Arweave, immutable contracts)
- Smaller-scale cultural models vs. high-volume trading

### Current Market Status (2026)
- **OpenSea**: >90% NFT trading volume, multi-chain, no buyer fees
- **SuperRare**: Curated fine art, invite-only, lower volume, $187M past 30 days (historical data)
- Specific 2026 active user counts unavailable in public sources
- Both platforms remain operational but strained by low volumes

### Zora - New Controversies Found
- **Tyson Fury "Celeb Coin Rug" (Late 2025)**: Jacob Horne promoted fake @TysonFury account via X (later deleted). Account created by trader "Sahil" without boxer's involvement. Quick pump → rugpull when banned. Holders like Artemis engineer Crystal Tai lost funds. ZachXBT labeled it a "celeb coin rug". Horne announced "internal process changes" - hide rule-breaking coins, ease exits for holders.
- **Technical vulnerabilities & bot exploitation**: Automated liquidity pools vulnerable to sniping bots. Bots detect new tokens within milliseconds, pump prices, then dump. Users exposed to immediate manipulation at token launch.
- **Systemic red flags**: 65% of tokens unlock within 6 months; ~90% of likes/comments are bot-generated; 90% of 27 tokens issued by Base team have gone to zero. Platform requires users to explicitly avoid scam tokens. Critics: Zora transforming internet creation into "on-chain casino".
- **Nick Shirley token crash**: Viral journalist's coin hit $9M market cap (Dec 2024), dropped 66-80% quickly. Mostly traded by crypto speculators, not his mainstream audience (118M+ Elon Musk shares). Caused 4% ZORA token drop.
- **Developer neglect claims (Jacek/Degen)**: Jacek criticized Base's heavy focus on Zora creator coins. "We still can't even get official Base X account to follow us... if you're not part of the favored narrative, you effectively don't exist." Incentive concern: "At that point, what is the incentive to build on Base?" When Degen bridged to Solana, got prompt backing from official Solana accounts.
- **Platform evolution (NFT → Memecoin pivot)**: Originally NFT platform (ERC-721/ERC-1155). Tested ERC-20z (hybrid) in 2024. Feb 2025 fully transitioned to ERC-20 "content coins". Supports Base, dropped 3D/MP3/PDF. Critics: "This won't be used to tokenize content—it will be used as a memecoin launcher. They pushed away content creators by taking away amazing features it used to have."

### Data Gaps Identified
- No specific artist reaction statements to Nifty Gateway shutdown
- No Arweave migration success rate data (how many users actually migrated?)
- No 2026 real-time metrics for platform health
- No case studies of artists migrating audiences between platforms

### Creator Coin Proponents & Defenders - New
**Documented in proponents.md:**
- **Jacob Horne**: Addresses "systemic issues in traditional systems"; dynamic pricing for creator products; creator coins paired with creator's token; feedback loop (more content → more trades → value flows back to creators)
- **Dee Goens**: Five years of experimentation led to creators earning millions; "Zora puts ownership and control back into the hands of creators"; transparency & permanence; zero intermediaries; permissionless trading
- **Jesse Pollak**: Open development; rejection of market manipulation; neutral infrastructure favoring organic price discovery
- **Brian Armstrong**: Bought 4.964M BALAJIS creator tokens on Zora (30% ZORA surge); defended economics vs. Hish Bouabdallah criticism; Base App content auto-syncs to Zora
- **Zack Guzman (Coinage)**: $90K → $10M valuation; top 200 on Zora leaderboard; $2,000 creator awards; creator coins enable community co-ownership via DAO; three years exploring US legal structures
- **Success stories**: "Base is for Everyone" ($17M market cap); Coinage ($10M); platform-wide metrics (1.787M coins, $27M+ rewards, $353–420M volume)

### Critical Nuance
**Vitalik Buterin is NOT a Supporter:**
Despite some coverage suggesting endorsement, Vitalik actually **criticizes** Zora's creator coin model:
- **Core criticism**: "Market outcomes still largely reflect existing social capital rather than sustained creative contribution"
- **Problem not solved**: Model "doesn't effectively discover or elevate quality creators based on merit alone"
- **Alternative proposal**: Curated DAOs (~200 members) as quality filters + prediction markets betting on DAO curation decisions
- **Fundamental critique**: Platforms like Zora remain "optimized for price discovery, not cultural or intellectual judgment"
