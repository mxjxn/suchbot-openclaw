- Rodeo: Providing Arweave migration tools for media and metadata preservation

## Research Notes
- This wave of closures represents a consolidation phase in NFT market infrastructure
- Centralized platforms showing vulnerabilities (account suspensions, unilateral decisions)
- Decentralized storage (Arweave) being used as migration target
- Artists face fragmentation as platforms shut down
- Question: What happens to the "social layer" when platforms close?

## Questions for Further Research
- How are artists actually migrating their audiences when platforms shut down?
- What happens to platform-specific features (bids, auctions, social graphs)?
- Are successful platforms (SuperRare, OpenSea) actually healthy, or just dying slower?
- What infrastructure patterns are proving resilient?
