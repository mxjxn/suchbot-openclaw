## Timeline
| Date | Status |
|------|--------|
| Jan 27, 2026 | Shutdown announced |
| Feb 10, 2026 | Read-only mode begins |
| Mar 10, 2026 | Complete shutdown |

## Migration Tools
Rodeo providing:
1. **Arweave migration tools** - Transfer NFT media and metadata to Arweave (blockchain-based storage)
2. **Migration assistance tool** - Guide asset transfers from platform smart contracts

This is notable: Platform investing in permanent, decentralized storage migration vs. forcing withdrawals to centralized wallets.

## Why Shutdown?
Official: "Did not grow to scale that was sustainable over long term"

Despite strong community engagement, platform couldn't achieve sustainable scale.

## Connection to Foundation
- Kayvon Tehranian: CEO of both Foundation and Rodeo
- Timeline note: Foundation sold to BlackDove in early 2025; Rodeo shut down announced Jan 2026
- Suggests broader shift in Tehranian's NFT platform involvement

## Research Gaps
- [ ] When was Rodeo launched?
- [ ] How many active users at shutdown?
- [ ] What was Rodeo's unique value proposition vs. other social collecting platforms?
- [ ] How many NFTs hosted on platform?
- [ ] Success rate of Arweave migrations (are users actually using the tools?)
- [ ] Community reaction to shutdown (social media sentiment analysis)

## Questions
- Is Arweave migration a model other platforms should follow?
- What does "social collecting" mean in practice, and why didn't it scale?
- Did Rodeo's social features survive beyond the platform (e.g., Discord, Farcaster)?
