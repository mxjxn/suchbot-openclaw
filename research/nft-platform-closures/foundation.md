## Research Gaps
- [ ] When exactly was the transfer completed?
- [ ] What are BlackDove's plans for Foundation?
- [ ] How has the platform changed under new ownership?
- [ ] Artist community reaction to transfer?
- [ ] Did any Foundation features or policies change post-transfer?
- [ ] What is BlackDove's background and strategy?

## Questions
- Is this a positive development (platform continues) or concerning (loss of founder vision)?
- How does Foundation compare to other surviving platforms (SuperRare, OpenSea)?
- What makes Foundation's model sustainable when Rodeo's wasn't?

## Comparison: Foundation vs. Rodeo
Both owned by Kayvon Tehranian:
- Foundation: Sold to BlackDove, continues operating
- Rodeo: Shutting down (March 2026)

Key difference: Foundation had $230M in primary sales vs. Rodeo's lack of scale. Suggests critical mass threshold for sustainability.
