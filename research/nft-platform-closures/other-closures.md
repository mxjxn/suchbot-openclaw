### Early Innovators First to Fail
- **Async Art** (2023): One of first to exit
- Suggests experimental models didn't find sustainable product-market fit

### Traditional Institutions Retreating
- Christie's Digital Art department (Sep 2025)
- Sotheby's NFT team layoffs
- Traditional art world didn't find sustained value in cryptoart

## Research Gaps
- [ ] Details on MakersPlace closure (announcement, migration, impact)
- [ ] KnownOrigin post-acquisition strategy (why did eBay shut it down?)
- [ ] Async Art community impact (what happened to dynamic NFTs after shutdown?)
- [ ] Christie's/Sotheby's reasoning for retreat from digital art
- [ ] Kraken NFT, Bybit NFT, X2Y2 details (why closed? migration?)
- [ ] LG Art Lab closure context (consumer electronics + cryptoart experiment?)

## Questions
- Why did some platforms survive (SuperRare, OpenSea) while others failed?
- What role did community size vs. funding play in survival?
- Did experimental art forms (Async Art's dynamic NFTs) have a future?
- What does traditional art world retreat signal for cryptoart legitimacy?
