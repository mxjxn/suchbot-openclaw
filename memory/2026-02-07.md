## Session Summary

### Completed
- **Telegram Markdown fix**: Added `markdown.tables: "bullets"` to OpenClaw config, restarted gateway (killed PID 11364). Markdown should now render correctly in Telegram.
- **Web3 Wagmi integration started**: User requested Web3 login with Wagmi for user identification on `bot.mxjxn.xyz`
  - Installed packages: `@astrojs/react`, `wagmi@latest`, `viem@latest`, `@tanstack/react-query`
  - Ran `npx astro add react` to integrate React with Astro
  - Created `web/src/components/ConnectWallet.jsx` - basic wallet connect/disconnect component using wagmi hooks
  - Added import to `web/src/pages/index.astro`

### In Progress / Blocked
- **Build failing**: `ConnectWallet is not defined` error during Astro build
  - Root cause: The `index.astro` file got malformed during edit - content duplicated/corrupted
  - Need to: Rewrite `index.astro` cleanly with proper import and `client:load` directive on `<ConnectWallet client:load />`
  - Also need: Wagmi provider setup (WagmiConfig wrapper) - currently missing, will cause runtime errors

### Next Steps
1. Fix `index.astro` - rewrite clean version with:
   - Proper import: `import ConnectWallet from '../components/ConnectWallet.jsx';`
   - Component usage: `<ConnectWallet client:load />`
2. Create Wagmi config file with chain configuration
3. Wrap app in WagmiProvider (likely needs a React wrapper component or Astro layout modification)
4. Build and deploy to `/var/www/bot.mxjxn.xyz/`
5. Phase 3: Backend API for user input collection

### User Goal (Big Picture)
- Web3 login to identify users
- Collect user input on website
- Organize input into documents for discussion with Suchbot
- Ultimate: increase monthly revenue, build community around on-chain art projects

### Key Files
- Config: `/root/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
- Website source: `./web/`
- Website deploy: `/var/www/bot.mxjxn.xyz/`
- New component: `web/src/components/ConnectWallet.jsx`

### User Context
- Communicating via Telegram (@maxjackson, id: 1231002024)
- Prefers terse, non-pandering responses
- Working on Farcaster-first auction house and autonomous on-chain artist project
